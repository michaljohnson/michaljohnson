### 🙋🏼‍♀ About me
I am a Software Engineering student with a strong interest in software architecture and IT project management.

Experience in full-stack development, machine learning PoCs, and modern backend/frontend technologies. I care about clean architecture, maintainable code, and well-structured systems that scale in real-world environments and I love teaming up with other devs to build cool stuff and fix problems.
When I am not working on coding projects, I enjoy spending time with my husband and son, hiking, making music, lifting weights, or taking photos
